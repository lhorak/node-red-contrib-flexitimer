# NodeRED FlexiTimer node

## About the project

This node serves as a flexible timer, which allows you to not only set a timer and output at the end, but a lot of other features. First of all,
the outputs are decoupled, so the node provides you with three different outputs. One when the timer starts, second one that gets triggered when the timer ends,
and a third one, which serves as an updater. The updater outputs the current state and the remaining time on the timer. The user is able to manipulate already running timer
with adding, subtracting or setting a time to the timer.
